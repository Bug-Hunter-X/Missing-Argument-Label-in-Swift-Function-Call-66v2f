# Missing Argument Label in Swift Function Call

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift related to function argument labels.  When calling a function with labeled arguments, you must provide the argument label, even if the parameter name is self-explanatory.  Failure to do so results in a compiler error.

The `bug.swift` file shows the incorrect usage, leading to a compiler error. The `bugSolution.swift` file provides the corrected code.
